  <p class="textchunk">Hi! I'm Ben Irick. I am a student at Illinois State University. I am majoring in Creative Technology. My emphasis is in Game Design but my main focus is Sound Design. I have experience in many Adobe programs. I have the most experience in Adobe Audition but I also have experience in Adobe Xd, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator. I've worked with Unity as well. I am also capable of basic, rudimentary Web Design (hence this site looking like it's straight out of 2005). I love music and I've been a member of the ISU drumline for 3 years, going on 4. My dream job would be doing Sound Design for animation. I just love the idea of bringing someone's artistic work to life with sound. <br></p>

<h3 id="abouth3">Additional Information</h3>
  <p class="textchunk"> I was born in 2000. I've always lived in Illinois. I like to play video games, play music, and exercise. I have many years of experience in both piano and percussion. I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Currently, my favorite color is indigo. My favorite place I've visited is Scotland.</p>
